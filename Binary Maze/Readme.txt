Step 1: Initial Binary State

I started with the binary number:
1100101011110010₂

This was the base number for all the operations I needed to perform.
Step 2: Logical Gates Room
2.1. AND Gate:

First, I performed a bitwise AND operation with 1010110010101101₂:

1100101011110010
AND 1010110010101101
----------------------
1000100010100000

The result after the AND operation was 1000100010100000₂.
2.2. OR Gate:

Next, I applied a bitwise OR operation with 0111001100110011₂:

1000100010100000
OR  0111001100110011
----------------------
1111101110110011

The result after the OR operation was 1111101110110011₂.
2.3. XOR Gate:

Then, I performed a bitwise XOR operation with 1101110111001110₂:

1111101110110011
XOR 1101110111001110
----------------------
0010011001111101

The result after the XOR operation was 0010011001111101₂.
2.4. NOT Gate:

I applied a NOT operation to the result from the XOR operation (0010011001111101₂), which inverted all the bits:

NOT 0010011001111101
----------------------
1101100110000010

The result after the NOT operation was 1101100110000010₂.
Step 3: Binary Conversion Room
3.1. Convert Binary to Decimal:

Next, I converted the binary result 1101100110000010₂ to decimal:

1101100110000010₂ = 55362₁₀

3.2. Perform Arithmetic Operations:

    I added 123 to the decimal number:

55362 + 123 = 55485

Then, I multiplied the result by 7:

    55485 * 7 = 388395

3.3. Convert the Final Result Back to Binary:

Finally, I converted 388395₁₀ back to binary:

388395₁₀ = 1011110110101111011₂

Step 4: Weighted Binary Balancing

I was given 15 items, each with a binary weight, and one was slightly heavier. The weights were as follows:

1001₂, 1100₂, 1110₂, 1010₂, 0111₂, 0101₂, 0011₂, 1111₂,
1101₂, 1011₂, 0110₂, 0100₂, 0010₂, 0001₂, and one unknown heavier binary number.

Using logic, I deduced that the unknown heavier weight was likely 10000₂, as it’s slightly larger than the heaviest known weight (1111₂).

Thus, the heaviest weight was 10000₂, or 16₁₀ in decimal.
Step 5: Binary Tree Navigation

I needed to navigate through a binary tree to find the path to the binary number 10111₂. The path had to contain an even number of 1s.

Since 10111₂ has four 1s (which is an even number), the path was valid, and I successfully navigated to the correct leaf node.
Step 6: Binary Sequence Game

The goal was to make all bits in the sequence 10101011010100101110₂ equal to 1 by flipping exactly three bits per move.

After analyzing the sequence, I flipped the bits in the following positions:

    Flip bits at positions 2, 4, and 6.
    Flip bits at positions 8, 10, and 12.
    Flip bits at positions 14, 16, and 18.

After three moves, all the bits were 1.
Step 7: Binary Palindromes

Next, I checked if the binary number 1011011101₂ was a palindrome. Since it wasn’t, I flipped the middle bit (at position 5) to make it one.

After flipping the bit, the new binary number was 1011111101₂, which is a palindrome.
Step 8: Complex Binary Patterns

Given a 10-bit binary number, I identified all numbers that had exactly four 1s. Some examples included:

    1111000000₂, 1110100000₂, 1110010000₂, 1101100000₂, etc.

I then converted these numbers to decimal. For example:

    1111000000₂ = 960₁₀
    1110100000₂ = 928₁₀

Step 9: Binary XOR Pairs with Constraints

From the array of binary numbers [101010₂, 011011₂, 110100₂, 001101₂, 100110₂, 111111₂, 000000₂], I found two numbers whose XOR gave the maximum result, while ensuring the pair didn’t have more than three consecutive 1s.

The pair 110100₂ and 011011₂ gave the maximum XOR result without exceeding the constraint.
Step 10: Binary Multiples and Remainders

I checked if the binary number 1101010₂ was a multiple of 7. After converting it to decimal (106₁₀), I divided it by 7 and found that the remainder was 1, meaning it wasn’t a multiple of 7.
Final Step: Final Calculation

The final binary number I obtained from Step 3 was 1011110110101111011₂. I converted this to decimal:

1011110110101111011₂ = 388395₁₀

Finally, I multiplied this result by 5:

388395 * 5 = 1941975

Final Result:

The final decimal number I obtained after completing all the steps was 1941975.
